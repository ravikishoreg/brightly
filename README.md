## Quiz Results Storage

The platform now includes a comprehensive quiz results storage system:

### Features:
- **Automatic Storage**: All quiz results are automatically saved to browser localStorage

- **Smart Cleanup**: Automatically removes oldest results when storage is full
- **Storage Limits**: 4.5MB storage limit with automatic cleanup
- **Result History**: View all quiz attempts across all quiz types
- **Detailed View**: Click any result to see complete quiz details

### How to Use:
1. Click "ðŸ“Š View Quiz Results History" button on the main page
2. View summary of all quiz attempts with scores and timestamps
3. Click "View Details" to see complete quiz results
4. Use "Delete" to remove individual results
5. Use "Clear All Results" to remove all stored data

### Storage Management:
- Maximum 100 results stored
- Automatic compression reduces storage size by ~70%
- Oldest results automatically removed when limits are reached
- Storage statistics displayed in the results viewer

## Troubleshooting

```bash
# Clear dependencies and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Check Node.js version (should be 16+)
node --version

# Debug mode in browser console
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true');
```
